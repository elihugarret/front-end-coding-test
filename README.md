## ES6+ Features

### Arrow Functions
Used in almost everywhere, like defining components and for mapping through an array, mainly beacause the expressiveness of this new syntax.

### Template Literals
Used to write styles in my components with JSX and for string interpolation to pass data in API queries.

### Classes
One of the most important feature for writing down React components, used it mainly in the rendering process of the index and commits pages. Gives you more intuitive Object Oriented and the benefits of inheritance.

### Promises
Mostly used in this project in the server part with the Express framework.
